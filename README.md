# UnlistedObjectsinEditor
If, for some reason, you want to enable unstable objects, replace line 26 of mod.json with this:

	"one-of": [ "only nonreplicable objects", "all stable objects", "no secret coin", "unstable objects" ],

This is nearly guaranteed to cause the game to crash when entering the level editor.
